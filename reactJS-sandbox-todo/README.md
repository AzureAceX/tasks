# reactJS-sandbox
 
Pop it open in Vs code

Open 2 new terminals
1) In one you can start the front end with npm start 
// You might run into issues with conflicting react versions, you can then just nppm upgrade --force' and use the latest, the versioning will be sorted in the future.
// You may get warnings for 'config global `--global`, `--local` are deprecated. Use `--location=global` instead.' You can go ahead and resolve it if you feel like it...but it wont get in the way quite yet so its not needed 

2) In the second terminal run 'node index.js' to start the backend server
//As it stands, the mongo Atlas server wont let you start if your IP address isnt whitelisted so yea....
