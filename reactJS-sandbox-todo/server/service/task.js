/*
----------------
populate CHILD TASKS and update in DB

why
- so when you try to delete a task or update task, we can use that column in doc to search through the array of children, get their states and see if it can be deleted markede as completed 
(foreach(task in  childasks: if task.status != complete return "One or more child tasks are not completed, this task cannot be deleted or updated as complete."))
- if they have no child the automatially we can mark it as complete

when is a childTask [] made
- on creation, we set parent task. So use .parentTask to find parent task, and append .title to the parents record
- this makes create require a fine_by_title call... title isnt unique tho..
